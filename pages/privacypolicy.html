							<p>Respecting our players' privacy is seriously important to us. <b>Made in Brooklyn Games does not directly collect any data from our games</b>. Instead, we rely on data provided to us by the platforms that our games are available on. The privacy policies for those platforms can be found here below.</p>

							<h2>Mailing List and Support Requests</h2>
							<h3>When you give us information</h3>
							<p>If you subscribe to our mailiing list through our website, we will store the information you give us. You can unsubscribe at any time using <a href="http://turbo-button.com/unsubscribe">this link</a> to remove all of that information from our server. If you ask us for support, we may ask for your username (on whatever platform you purchased the game on), but we only use that information for that specific support request.</p>
						
							<h3>Communicating with you</h3>
							<p>If you provide us with your email address, we'll use it exclusively for the reason you provided it to us (direct support requests or our mailing list). We do not use your email address (or any of your data) for marketing to you unless you sign up for our mailing list.</p>

							<h2>Additional information</h2>
							<h3>Children under the age of 16</h3>
							<p>We never knowingly collect personal information from any person under the age of 16. If you are under the age of 16, you need parental permission to sign up for our mailing list.</p>

							<h3>Removing your data</h3>
							<p>If you wish to unsubscribe from our mailing list, you can do using <a href="https://hessvacio.com">this link</a>. Because we do not collect data from our games, we are not able to remove that data by request (since we have no method of linking your data back to your device or platform account). Consult the privacy policy for the platform or service you purchased our game from.</p>

							<h3>Contacting us with concerns</h3>
							<p>If you have any more questions or concerns, feel free to <a href="http://hessvacio.com">reach out to us</a>.</p>
