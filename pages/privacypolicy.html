  <h3>3.2. ADVERTISING</h3>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising is one of the tools that helps fund our Services and enables us to make our Games available free of charge. In some of our Games, we may show our own ads and also ads from third parties. We also advertise our Games outside of our Services on third-party properties such as websites or applications. This section provides more information on how we may use your data for advertising purposes, and how you can control the use of your data for these purposes. Mobile advertising relies on the use of certain online identifiers, in particular Advertising IDs but also IP addresses or other identifiers. An “</span><b>Advertising ID</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">” is an alphanumeric string of digits provided by the operating system of your mobile device (e.g. your phone or tablet). It is consistent across applications from different publishers. The Advertising ID is known as the Identifier for Advertisers (“</span><b>IDFA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) on iOS devices and Google Advertising Identifier (“</span><b>GAID</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">”) on Android devices. Advertising IDs are used for interest-based advertising and other advertising related purposes. You can control the extent to which your Advertising ID is used for these purposes. Using the privacy settings on your device, you can typically reset and/or limit the use of your Advertising ID. For example, you can “limit ad tracking” on iOS devices or “opt out of interest-based ads” on Android devices. These settings are specific to each device, which means that you should set them as you prefer on each of your devices individually. It may take some time for your updated settings to take effect. Please consider that resetting or limiting the use of your Advertising ID will not stop you from seeing ads or necessarily reduce the number of ads you see, but the ads you see may be less relevant to you and will not be served based on your personal data. For more information on mobile privacy settings, you may refer to third-party resources such as:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>https://www.networkadvertising.org/mobile-choice</b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
  </span></a><b>When you see ads in our Games</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we may share your Advertising ID and IP address with our advertising partners if you have given your consent to the use of your data for personalized ads. Our advertising partners may also collect information directly from our Games through technologies such as software development kits (SDKs). In each case, they may use your data for a number of purposes, including to limit the number of times you see an ad or to personalize the ads you see to make them more relevant to you (for example, based on the past activity they have associated with your Advertising ID). For more information, please refer to the privacy policies of our advertising partners listed&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.tiltingpoint.com/data-recipients"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><b>here</b></span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you do not provide us with consent to use your data for personalized ads, we will not share your personal data (such as Advertising ID) with our advertising partners and will indicate to them that you have not consented to the use of this data for personalized ads.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
  </span><b>When you see our ads outside of our Services</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;(for example, on third-party properties such as websites or applications), the ad network involved in delivering that ad to you may, based on information such as the past activity they have associated with your Advertising ID, have determined that you may be interested in our Services. Ad networks may also use your data to:</span></p>
  <ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">limit the number of times you see our ads;</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">inform users who have previously played our Games about new content, updates, or other news related to those Games; or</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">refrain from showing our ads to users who already play the Game being advertised.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, ad networks may provide services where they use Advertising IDs or other identifiers to find users who are likely to be interested in our Services because their past activity or interests are similar to those of others known by the ad network to use our Services. When ad-networks use your Advertising ID in these ways, they do so based on their respective privacy policies or notices.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><b>For both ads in our Games and our ads outside of our Services</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Advertising IDs or other identifiers are also used for ad measurement, which involves the collection of metrics such as total views, clicks, or installs generated by an ad. Measurement data may be directly or indirectly collected or received by multiple parties involved in ad delivery (including us and our advertising partners), for example through technologies such as web beacons inserted into ads. This data is used for purposes such as to provide measurement services, to detect, investigate and prevent fraud or fraudulent behavior, or to settle payments between the parties involved in ad delivery.</span></p>
  <h2>4. WHAT DATA DO WE PROCESS?</h2>

  <h2>7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA?</h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will keep your data for as long as necessary to achieve the purpose(s) for which it was collected, including to provide you with the Services or to comply with any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. We may periodically delete or de-identify inactive accounts or other data in our Games or other Services. After the applicable retention period, we will either delete or de-identify your data or, if neither deletion or de-identification is possible (for example, due to data being stored on a backup server), isolate your data from further processing until deletion or de-identification is possible.

These measures are designed to protect your data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, or alteration as well as unauthorized disclosure or access. The specific measures we employ vary depending on the sensitivity of the data, but typically include, for example, encryption, pseudonymization of identifying data where feasible, controls to limit access to services or systems that contain personal data, and maintaining procedures to handle any suspected security incidents.</span></p>

  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How We May Sell Your Personal Information</span></li>
  </ol>
  <h2></h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the CCPA, a business is required to provide notice to a consumer before the business sells the consumer’s personal information to third parties. the CCPA defines a “sale” as not only exchanges for monetary consideration, but also disclosures of personal information for other valuable consideration.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not sell your personal information in exchange for money. However, we may disclose a limited amount of your personal information (i) to our advertising partners to enable them to deliver an ad that is relevant to you or (ii) to our marketing partners to enable them to send you relevant offers when you have opted in to such communication. This includes the following categories of your personal information:</span></p>
  <ul>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">identifiers (generally including an advertising ID and your IP address for ad partners and name and email for marketing partners); and</span></li>
  <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">internet or other electronic network activity information (including technical information required to select and deliver the appropriate ad type and format).</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because this disclosure of information could be deemed a “sale” in the meaning of the CCPA, we either ask for your explicit consent or provide a means for you to direct us to not disclose your personal information to our advertising or marketing partners for the above purposes. To learn how to exercise your right to opt-out, please see “Right to Opt Out,” above.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we have actual knowledge that you are under 16 years old, we will not sell your personal information without affirmative authorization.</span></p>
